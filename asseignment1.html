                <h3>USING ORDER LIST</h3><li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). </li>
            <li>Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies in use today, many disagree on whether these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some argue that much of the technology used in the real world today actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a first step towards true artificial intelligence, or “general artificial intelligence” (GAI).</li>
        <li>Yet, despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether “true” intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, they’re referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data.

            <h3>USING UNORDER LIST</h3>
            <li>AI systems are vulnerable to security risks, including data breaches and hacking. As AI becomes more prevalent in critical infrastructure, the potential for catastrophic cyber-attacks increases. For example, AI-powered energy grids are susceptible to hacking, which could lead to widespread power outages and endanger public safety. The complexity of AI systems makes them difficult to secure, posing a significant challenge in an increasingly interconnected world.</li>
            <li>The debate around AI is not merely about its capabilities but also about its broader impact on society, economy, and individual rights. Questions around privacy, job displacement, and decision-making autonomy are becoming increasingly prominent.
